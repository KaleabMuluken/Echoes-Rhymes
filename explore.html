                        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
                        And sorry I could not travel both  
                        And be one traveler, long I stood  
                        And looked down one as far as I could  
                        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then took the other, as just as fair,  
                        And having perhaps the better claim,  
                        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  
                        Though as for that the passing there  
                        Had worn them really about the same,
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And both that morning equally lay  
                        In leaves no step had trodden black.  
                        Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
                        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
                        I doubted if I should ever come back.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I shall be telling this with a sigh  
                        Somewhere ages and ages hence:  
                        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—  
                        I took the one less traveled by,  
                        And that has made all the difference.

                    <p>
                        I met a traveler from an antique land  
                        Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
                        Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,  
                        Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown  
                        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
                        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
                        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
                        The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.  
                        And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
                        My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;  
                        Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
                        Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,  
                        The lone and level sands stretch far away.

                    <p>
                        I wandered lonely as a cloud  
                        That floats on high o'er vales and hills,  
                        When all at once I saw a crowd,  
                        A host, of golden daffodils;  
                        Beside the lake, beneath the trees,  
                        Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Continuous as the stars that shine  
                        And twinkle on the milky way,  
                        They stretched in never-ending line  
                        Along the margin of a bay:  
                        Ten thousand saw I at a glance,  
                        Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The waves beside them danced; but they  
                        Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:  
                        A poet could not but be gay,  
                        In such a jocund company:  
                        I gazed—and gazed—but little thought  
                        What wealth the show to me had brought:
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For oft, when on my couch I lie  
                        In vacant or in pensive mood,  
                        They flash upon that inward eye  
                        Which is the bliss of solitude;  
                        And then my heart with pleasure fills,  
                        And dances with the daffodils.

                    <p>
                        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  
                        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—  
                        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  
                        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.  
                        "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door—  
                        Only this and nothing more."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;  
                        And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.  
                        From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—  
                        For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—  
                        Nameless here for evermore.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  
                        Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  
                        So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating  
                        "'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—  
                        Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—  
                        This it is and nothing more."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  
                        "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;  
                        But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,  
                        And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,  
                        That I scarce was sure I heard you"—here I opened wide the door;—  
                        Darkness there and nothing more.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,  
                        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;  
                        But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,  
                        And the only words there spoken were the whispered words, "Lenore?"  
                        This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"—  
                        Merely this and nothing more.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,  
                        Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.  
                        "Surely," said I, "surely there is something at my window lattice;  
                        Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—  
                        Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—  
                        'Tis the wind and nothing more!"
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,  
                        In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;  
                        Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;  
                        But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—  
                        Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—  
                        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  
                        By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,  
                        "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,  
                        Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—  
                        Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"  
                        Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  
                        Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;  
                        For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  
                        Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—  
                        Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,  
                        With such name as "Nevermore."
